## The Problem

### Geography Learning is Boring and Lacks Competitive Engagement
Most geography learning tools are either dry educational apps with flashcards and quizzes, or casual games that don't provide real competitive tension. Players want the thrill of competing against friends in real-time, combined with the satisfaction of improving their geographic knowledge through progressive difficulty.

**Our Solution:** Fast-paced 30-second rounds where players race to pin cities on a map, combining the competitive thrill of multiplayer battles with progressive single-player difficulty that makes learning geography addictive and rewarding.

## Differentiators

### Real-Time Competitive Map Pinning
Unlike traditional geography quizzes with multiple choice answers, GeoQuest requires players to actively explore and pin locations on an interactive map. The 30-second time pressure and real-time "who's closest" scoring creates genuine competitive tension that makes every round exciting.

### Dual Game Mode Philosophy
Unlike purely multiplayer games or single-player progression games, GeoQuest offers both competitive friend battles (5-round matches with room codes) and infinite solo progression (levels 1 to infinity with increasing difficulty). This ensures players always have engaging content whether friends are online or not.

### Progressive Difficulty Without Frustration
Starting with popular, recognizable cities at Level 1 and gradually introducing more obscure locations, the single-player mode creates a natural learning curve. Players build confidence with familiar locations before being challenged with harder geography, making the learning process feel rewarding rather than overwhelming.

### Mobile-First Map Exploration
Designed specifically for smartphone touch interfaces with pan, zoom, and pin placement optimized for mobile screens. The map shows country outlines in colors without labels, creating visual recognition challenges that feel natural on mobile devices.

## Key Features
