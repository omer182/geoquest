# Spec Initialization: Interactive Map Component

**Date:** 2025-12-17

**Phase:** Phase 1 (Roadmap)

## Feature Description

Build the core map interface with Leaflet.js integration, allowing users to pan, zoom, and place pins on touch-enabled mobile screens. Include country boundary visualization with colored outlines but no country labels.

This is Phase 1 from the product roadmap and is the foundation for the entire game.

## Context

This feature represents the foundational component of GeoQuest - the interactive map that users will interact with to play the geography guessing game. Without this component, no gameplay is possible.

## Initial Scope

- Leaflet.js integration
- Pan and zoom functionality
- Touch-enabled pin placement
- Country boundary visualization
- Colored country outlines
- No country labels (intentional for gameplay)
- Mobile-first responsive design
