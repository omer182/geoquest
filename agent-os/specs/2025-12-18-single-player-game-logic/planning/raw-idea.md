# Phase 2: Single Player Game Logic

## Feature Description

Implement infinite progression single-player mode with level system (starting at Level 1), city database organized by difficulty, 5 cities per level, and distance calculation algorithm to determine scoring accuracy.

## Key Aspects

- Level system that starts at Level 1 and progresses infinitely
- City/country database with difficulty tiers
- 5 questions per level
- Distance calculation using Haversine formula (lat/lng to kilometers)
- Scoring algorithm based on accuracy
- Game state management for rounds and levels
- Progressive difficulty as levels increase

## Dependencies

This builds on Phase 1 (Interactive Map Component) which provides the map interface and pin placement functionality.
