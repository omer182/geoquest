## Deploying to iOS

### Option 1: Progressive Web App (PWA) - Recommended

**Easiest path to get on iOS devices without App Store:**

1. **Add PWA manifest** (create `public/manifest.json`):
```json
{
  "name": "GeoQuest",
  "short_name": "GeoQuest",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#0a0e1a",
  "theme_color": "#3b82f6",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Add manifest to `index.html`**:
```html
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icon-192.png">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent">
```

3. **Deploy to a hosting service** (choose one):
   - **Vercel:** `npm i -g vercel && vercel` (easiest)
   - **Netlify:** Drag `dist` folder to netlify.com
   - **Railway:** Connect GitHub repo
   - **Render:** Connect GitHub repo

4. **Install on iPhone:**
   - Open your deployed URL in Safari
   - Tap Share button → "Add to Home Screen"
   - App installs like a native app!

**Pros:** No App Store approval, instant updates, works on Android too
**Cons:** No access to native APIs, must use Safari to install

---

### Option 2: Capacitor (Native iOS App)

**For App Store distribution:**

1. **Install Capacitor**:
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios
npx cap init GeoQuest com.yourname.geoquest --web-dir=dist
```

2. **Build frontend**:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. **Add iOS platform**:
```bash
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync
```

4. **Open in Xcode**:
```bash
npx cap open ios
```

5. **Configure in Xcode**:
   - Set your Team (Apple Developer account required - $99/year)
   - Update Bundle Identifier
   - Add icons and splash screens
   - Configure capabilities (network, location if needed)

6. **Test on device**:
   - Connect iPhone
   - Select your device in Xcode
   - Click Run (▶️)

7. **Submit to App Store**:
   - Archive in Xcode (Product → Archive)
   - Use App Store Connect to submit
   - Wait for Apple review (1-3 days)

**Pros:** Full native app, App Store visibility, push notifications
**Cons:** $99/year dev account, App Store approval process

---

### Option 3: TestFlight (Beta Testing)

For testing before App Store:

1. Follow Capacitor steps above (1-6)
2. In Xcode: Product → Archive
3. Upload to App Store Connect
4. Add external testers (up to 10,000)
5. Share TestFlight link with testers

**Pros:** Real device testing, no App Store approval for beta
**Cons:** Still need $99/year dev account

---

### Recommendation

**Start with PWA** - It's free, fast, and perfect for friends/portfolio. You can deploy in 5 minutes on Vercel and share a link.

**Upgrade to Capacitor later** if you want App Store distribution or need native features.

## Game Modes

### Single Player
- Infinite levels: 10 difficulty levels, then endless play on the hardest pool
- 5 cities per level, at most one per country
- Pass a level by reaching its target score (out of 5,000)

### Multiplayer
- 2-5 players per room
- 5-round matches, easiest city first
- Host picks difficulty (Easy: levels 1-3, Medium: 4-7, Hard: 8-10) and timer (15s/30s/45s/60s)
- Up to +25% speed bonus per round; ties are broken by accuracy
- Real-time synchronization
- Rematch functionality

### Scoring and levels
- Each round scores 0-1,000: 1,000 within 10 km, then smooth exponential decay.
- The decay scale grows with the size of the city's country (the prompt always names the
  country), so precision counts about the same everywhere, with a floor so small countries
  aren't brutal.
- `backend/data/cities.json` is the single city list for client and server. Each city's
  `level` comes from a simulation of its expected score (how obscure it is and how hard it
  is to place inside its country), and level targets are calibrated so a casual player
  passes level 1 about 85% of the time and level 10 about 30%.
